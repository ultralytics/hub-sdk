Welcome to the Ultralytics HUB-SDK documentation! üìñ This guide will walk you through the installation process and help you get started using the HUB-SDK for your [machine learning (ML)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) projects. The SDK provides tools to interact programmatically with [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub).

## üöÄ Quickstart: Installing HUB-SDK

Ready to dive into the HUB-SDK? Follow these steps to set it up on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Python:** The HUB-SDK requires Python 3.8 or later. If you don't have Python installed, download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git (Optional):** If you plan to install the HUB-SDK directly from the GitHub repository or contribute to the project, you'll need Git. Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if necessary.

### Installation Methods

You can install the HUB-SDK using either of the following methods:

#### Install from PyPI

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/hub-sdk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/hub-sdk) [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/hub-sdk)](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/hub-sdk)

For the latest stable release, install the HUB-SDK from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hub-sdk/) using pip:

```sh
pip install hub-sdk
```

#### Install from GitHub

To get the very latest development version, you can clone the repository and install it locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/hub-sdk.git
cd hub-sdk
pip install -e .
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Let's get started using the HUB-SDK to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete ([CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)) operations for Models, Datasets, and Projects on Ultralytics HUB.

### 1. Authenticate with Credentials

You need to authenticate your client. Choose one of the following methods:

#### Using an API Key

You can find or generate your API key in your Ultralytics HUB account settings.

```python
# Authenticate using your API key
credentials = {"api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
```

#### Using Email and Password

Alternatively, authenticate using your Ultralytics HUB email and password.

```python
# Authenticate using your email and password
credentials = {"email": "YOUR_EMAIL", "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"}
```

### 2. Initialize the HUBClient

Instantiate the `HUBClient` with your chosen credentials:

```python
# Initialize the client with your credentials
from hub_sdk import HUBClient

client = HUBClient(credentials)
```

### Operations

The following code snippets demonstrate how to perform CRUD operations on Projects, Models, and Datasets using the initialized client.

#### Project Operations

Manage your projects easily:

```python
# Get a specific project by its ID
project = client.project("PROJECT_ID")

# Create a new project (replace "PROJECT_DATA" with actual project details)
# create_project = project.create_project("PROJECT_DATA") # Assuming create_project exists and takes data

# List projects
projects = client.projects()  # Assuming a method to list projects exists

# Update an existing project (replace "UPDATE_DATA" with new data)
# update_project = project.update("UPDATE_DATA") # Assuming update exists and takes data

# Delete the project
# deleted_project = project.delete() # Assuming delete exists
```

#### Model Operations

Handle your models efficiently:

```python
# Get a specific model by its ID
model = client.model("MODEL_ID")

# Upload a new model (replace "MODEL_DATA" with actual model details/path)
# create_model = client.upload_model("MODEL_DATA") # Assuming upload_model exists

# List models associated with a project or account
models = client.models()  # Assuming a method to list models exists

# Update model details (replace "UPDATE_DATA" with new data)
# update_model = model.update("UPDATE_DATA") # Assuming update exists

# Delete the model
# deleted_model = model.delete() # Assuming delete exists
```

#### Dataset Operations

Dataset management is straightforward:

```python
# Get a specific dataset by its ID
dataset = client.dataset("DATASET_ID")

# Upload a new dataset (replace "DATASET_DATA" with actual dataset details/path)
# create_dataset = client.upload_dataset("DATASET_DATA") # Assuming upload_dataset exists

# List datasets
datasets = client.datasets()  # Assuming a method to list datasets exists

# Update dataset details (replace "UPDATE_DATA" with new information)
# update_dataset = dataset.update("UPDATE_DATA") # Assuming update exists

# Delete the dataset
# deleted_dataset = dataset.delete() # Assuming delete exists
```

**Note:** The exact method names (`create_project`, `update`, `delete`, `upload_model`, `upload_dataset`, `projects`, `models`, `datasets`) might differ. Please refer to the specific HUB-SDK documentation or source code for the correct API calls.
