    A class for interacting with Projects through CRUD operations, extending CRUDClient with project-specific methods.

    Attributes:
        hub_client (ProjectUpload): Instance for managing model uploads.
        id (str | None): Unique project identifier.
        data (dict): Dictionary storing project information.

    Methods:
        get_data: Retrieves and stores project details.
        create_project: Creates a new project and sets its ID.
        delete: Deletes the project, optionally hard (permanent).
        update: Updates project information.
        upload_image: Uploads an image associated with the project.

    Example:
        ```python
        projects = Projects(project_id='12345')
        projects.get_data()
        projects.create_project({'name': 'New Project'})
