class Teams(CRUDClient):
    """
    A class representing a client for interacting with Teams through CRUD operations.

    This class extends the CRUDClient class and provides specific methods for working with Teams. It allows users to
    create, read, update, and delete team data.

    Attributes:
        id (str | None): The unique identifier of the team, if available.
        data (dict): A dictionary to store team data.

    Methods:
        get_data: Retrieves data for the current team instance.
        create_team: Creates a new team with the provided data.
        delete: Deletes the team resource represented by this instance.
        update: Updates the team resource represented by this instance.

    Example:
        ```python
        team_client = Teams(team_id='1234abcd', headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer your_token'})
        team_client.get_data()
