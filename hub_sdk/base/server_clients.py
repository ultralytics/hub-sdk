    ModelUpload class for managing model uploads and interactions with the Ultralytics HUB API.

    This class extends the APIClient to provide functionality for uploading model weights, exporting models,
    uploading metrics, and managing heartbeats to the Ultralytics HUB. It contains methods for interacting
    with the Ultralytics backend to manage model lifecycle events.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The default name assigned to the models.
        alive (bool): A flag indicating whether the agent is active for sending heartbeats.
        agent_id (Optional[str]): The unique identifier for the agent sending heartbeats.
        rate_limits (dict): A dictionary storing rate limits for various activities like 'metrics', 'ckpt', and 'heartbeat'.

    Methods:
        upload_model(id, epoch, weights, is_best=False, map=0.0, final=False):
            Upload a model checkpoint to the Ultralytics HUB.

        upload_metrics(id: str, data: dict) -> Optional[Response]:
            Upload a file containing metrics for a specific entity.

        export(id: str, format: str) -> Optional[Response]:
            Export a model file for a specific entity.

        predict(id: str, image: str, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[Response]:
            Perform a prediction using the specified image and configuration.

        _start_heartbeats(model_id: str, interval: int) -> None:
            Begin a threaded heartbeat loop to report the agent's status to Ultralytics HUB.

        _stop_heartbeats() -> None:
            Stop the threaded heartbeat loop.

        _register_signal_handlers() -> None:
            Register signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT.

        _handle_signal(signum: int, frame: Any) -> None:
            Handle kill signals and prevent heartbeats from being sent on termination.
