# Project Management Operations

### Get Project by ID
Next, we retrieve a project using its unique identifier ('arP1HAMED0tcz770vG5l') and print its data:

```sh
project = client.project('<Project ID>')
print(project.data)
```

### Create Project
We start by creating a new project with the following metadata:

```sh
data = {"meta": {"name": "my project"}}
project = client.project()
project.create_project(data)
```

### Update Project
We can update the project by changing its name. Here, we update the project with the new name 'Project name update':

```sh
project = client.project('<Project ID>')
project.update({"meta": {"name": "Project name update"}})
```

### Delete Project
To remove a project, we use the project's unique identifier ('arP1HAMED0tcz770vG5l') and delete it:

```sh
project = client.project("<Project ID>")
project.delete()
```

# List Projects
This code snippet demonstrates how to use a Python client to list projects. The client appears to interact with some external system or service that provides a list of projects, likely in a paginated format. The code retrieves and prints project data from this service in a step-by-step fashion, allowing users to navigate through different pages of project listings.

```sh
projects = client.project_list(page_size=1, public=True)
print("Next:", projects.results)
projects.next()
print("Next:", projects.results)
projects.previous()
print("Previous Page:", projects.results)
```
