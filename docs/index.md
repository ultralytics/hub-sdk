# Ultralytics HUB-SDK

Welcome to the Ultralytics HUB-SDK documentation! If you're looking to integrate powerful machine learning tools and services into your Python applications, you've come to the right place. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a seasoned machine learning practitioner, or a software developer looking to harness the capabilities of Ultralytics services, our SDK makes it easy and efficient.

Our friendly and professional documentation will guide you on a journey from installation to mastery of the HUB-SDK. Let's dive in and start leveraging the full power of the Ultralytics ecosystem in your projects!

## Where to Start

Ready to hit the ground running with the HUB-SDK? Our quickstart guide offers a straightforward path to getting the SDK up and functioning in your Python environment.

- Propel your development forward and streamline your setup by visiting: [Quickstart](quickstart.md).

### Installing from PyPI

Gain access to the latest stable release of HUB-SDK through PyPI. Simply execute the command below in your terminal/shell to seamlessly add the SDK to your Python project:

```sh
pip install hub-sdk
```

After running this command, the SDK will be downloaded and installed, unlocking the capabilities of Ultralytics services in your application.

## Initialize HUBClient

Integration with Ultralytics services starts with the initialization of an `HUBClient` object. This pivotal step creates a bridge between your code and our APIs, and it requires appropriate credentials for authentication. You can opt for the standard API key method or use your email and password. Let's set it up together! ðŸš€

### Option 1: Using an API Key
To utilize the simplicity of an API key, prepare a dictionary with your key like so:

```python
credentials = {"api_key": "<YOUR-API-KEY>"}
# Replace <YOUR-API-KEY> with the actual key provided to you by Ultralytics.
```

By using an API key, you're choosing a common authentication method suitable for programmatic access. It's perfect for scenarios where integrating a key directly into your framework is desired for swift and secure service interaction.

### Option 2: Using Email and Password
Prefer to harness your account credentials? Configure the `HUBClient` with your email and password in the credentials dictionary:

```python
credentials = {"email": "<YOUR-EMAIL>", "password": "<YOUR-PASSWORD>"}
# Replace <YOUR-EMAIL> with your email address and <YOUR-PASSWORD> with your password.
```

Employing your email and password is a convenient choice if you're looking for a traditional login experience or aiming to utilize personalized features tied to your Ultralytics account.

### Bringing it All Together
Now that your credentials are prepared, initiate your `HUBClient`:

```python
client = HUBClient(credentials)
# The HUBClient is now initialized with your chosen authentication method.
```

This crucial line of code crafts a new instance of the HUBClient, connecting you to the vast landscape of services offered by the Ultralytics platform. With your authentication details securely in place, you're all set to explore the functionalities at your fingertips!
